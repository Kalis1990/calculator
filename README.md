## Task

1. The task is to create "Fuel Calculator" as Drupal module. In form it should have "Distance Traveled", "Fuel Consumption" and "Price Per Liter". Once this data is entered to our form after we press calculate button it should give us results  in separate result block "Fuel spent" and "Fuel cost". Also we need to have reset button to be able to reset our data.
2. Primary / Default values should be defined in the module as Drupal config install feature.
3. It should be possible to use calculator as separate page or embed block
